# Contributing to Glomble

Glomble is a Django project, and most features live in their own top-level app directories instead of one monolithic app. If you want to work on the codebase effectively, start by finding the app that owns the feature you want to change, then look at its `views.py`, `models.py`, and `urls.py`.

## Good to Know

- This repository uses separate directories for major features such as `videos`, `profiles`, `comments`, `reports`, `feedback`, and `notifications`.
- Frontend files are located within the separate directories, e.g. `videos/templates/videos/detail_video.html`. Note: The `profiles` and `videos` directory both have a `base.html` file, this is unintentional and should be combined into one later on.
- `profiles` and `videos` both currently have a `base.html` file. The README notes that this is accidental and should eventually be consolidated.
- The most important backend files are usually `views.py`, `models.py`, and `urls.py`. `Views.py` is for interaction between frontend and backend, `models.py` is for the database structure, and `urls.py` is used for assigning urls to views to access them. Another important backend file is `videos/templatetags/count.py`, this is used for interacting between the frontend and backend conveniently.
- A useful helper for templates and UI logic is `videos/templatetags/count.py`.

## Local Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment. (Optional)
   - On Windows:
     ```powershell
     python -m venv .venv
     .\.venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
2. Install dependencies.
   ```powershell
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Make sure the required local secret files exist in the repository root.
   
   | File | What it is for |
   | --- | --- |
   | `secret_key.txt` | Used by Django to ensure the app has a consistent identity across runs. |
   | `email.txt` | Tells the app which mailbox to send password resets and other mail from. |
   | `email_pass.txt` | Gives the app permission to log in to that mailbox. |
   | `testing_storage_access_key.txt` | Lets local runs upload to the test storage bucket. |
   | `testing_storage_secret_key.txt` | Pairs with the test bucket access key so uploads actually work. |
   | `storage_access_key.txt` | Lets production builds talk to the live storage bucket. |
   | `storage_secret_key.txt` | Pairs with the production storage access key for live uploads. |

   If you are only running locally, the testing storage files are the important ones. The production storage files are only needed when `LOCAL = False` in `Glomble/pc_prod.py`. 
   The files aren't verified, so you can usually just make a file saying something like `TestTestTestTestTestTestTestTest` if you don't have the real credentials. The app will still run, but some features like video uploads or emails might not work properly.
   
4. Apply database migrations.
   ```powershell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Run the development server.
   ```powershell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
6. Create an admin user if you need to test staff or moderation flows.
   ```powershell
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

## Making a Pull Request
